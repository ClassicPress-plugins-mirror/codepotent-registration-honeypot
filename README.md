# Registration Honeypot

Add a honeypot to your ClassicPress registration form to prevent spambots from creating user accounts.

# Usage

The _Registration Honeypot_ plugin adds a hidden input to the ClassicPress registration form. If the input contains any data when the form is submitted, the account will not be created. There are no settings â€“ just activate and watch account spam dwindle.
